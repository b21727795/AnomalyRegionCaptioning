# AnomalyRegionCaptioning

It is a study done within the scope of BBM416 Computer Vision course.

Autonomous systems have gained extreme popularity in various application areas such as self-driving cars, surveillance tasks, autonomous warehouses, and factory systems, and so on. While an autonomous vehicle perceives its environment, it must be prepared for unexpected situations as an abnormality or an outlier behavior in the operation of these systems can be extremely costly.

Therefore, classifying and understanding unexpected situations as well as explaining them will assure the cost-efficiency and the quality of the developed systems. In this line of work, one of the most recent research problems on these areas covers determining whether there is an outlier so called anomaly in the visual content or not. At this point, the undeniable performance of recent deep learning-based computer vision approaches has been motivating the researchers for developing novel models for detecting, classifying, segmenting, or describing the anomalies occurring on images/videos. However, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed approaches so far do not provide descriptive models about general-purpose abnormal cases in visual contents. The main focus of our work can be summarized as: (1) segmenting the anomalous objects and their relations with the environment, (2) generating textual descriptions for these anomalies. Also, we propose to extend the dataset provided in Hendrycks et al. (2019) with detailed captions on the anomalies.
